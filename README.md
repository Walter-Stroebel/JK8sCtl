Somewhat Work In Progress - Tooling for Kubernetes

Requirements for full functionality are Linux desktop with kubectl and GraphViz installed.

Omitting actual kubectl calls and showing diagrams it should work on Windows.

For editing the GUI stuff you will need NetBeans.

Components:
- Full graph of all objects in a cluster as a GraphViz graph
- Multi-tab editor for Yaml files
- Generator/Editor for Pods and Deployments
