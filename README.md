Very much Work In Progress - I'm trying to make tooling around kubectl

Requirements for full functionality are Linux desktop with kubectl and GraphViz installed.

Omitting actual kubectl calls and showing diagrams it should work on Windows.

For editing the GUI stuff you will need NetBeans.

  Right now there's a kind of tabbed Yaml editor if you run MainFrame. Can't say I've even seen that as a tool, by itself, if someone likes the idea, feel free to pick it up.
